# Sliding puzzle project

## Desc 

We would like you to build a sliding puzzle (example: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sliding_puzzle). 

## Must-haves:

* A game field of 3x3 with 8 blocks and one gap; if a block is clicked that borders the gap, it moves into the gap
* Random start locations; but without any duplicate blocks
* The blocks are numbered; 1 to 8
* Responsiveness; the game size adjusts to screen size
* A counter tracking the number of moves

## Nice-to-have:

* Parts of an image instead of numbers in the blocks
* Win-condition; if successfully completed, give some kind of feedback
* Dynamic number of blocks; some kind of input whereby the size of the game (and number of blocks) can be increased from 3x3 to any dimension

## Spec

The project has to be developed using ReactJS + TypeScript.
